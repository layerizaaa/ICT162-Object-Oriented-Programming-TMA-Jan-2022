# Overview - Golf Schedule Management

Hi there! This repository contains the codes developed for my ICT162 Object-Oriented Programming module. The project consists of four questions, each addressing different aspects of object-oriented programming concepts. The questions cover topics such as class design, inheritance, polymorphism, and exception handling. The project required Python scripts for managing golf schedules, including object-oriented programming modules and a Tkinter GUI application.
